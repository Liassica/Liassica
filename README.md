# Welcome to my profile!

Most of my projects, including my [website](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/site) and [NixOS configuration](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/nixos-config) have been moved to [my Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/Liassica). However, I still use this account for a few things.

GitHub won't let me add my committing email address to my account so my commits may show as "unverified" on the web UI (Codeberg has no issue!). If you check manually you'll see it's me; my public key fingerprint for Git commits is `83BE 3033 6164 B971 FA82  7036 0D34 0E59 4980 7BDD`.
