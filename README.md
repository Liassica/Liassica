# Welcome to my profile!

Most of my projects, including my [website](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/site) and [NixOS configuration](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/nixos-config) have been moved to [my Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/Liassica). However, I still use this account for a few things.

My public key fingerprint for Git commits is `83BE 3033 6164 B971 FA82  7036 0D34 0E59 4980 7BDD`.

A few of my older commits will show as "unverified" on the GitHub UI because it took me way too long to realize I can set my email per-repo. If you check the commits manually you'll see they're me.
