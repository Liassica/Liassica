# Welcome to my profile!

Most of my projects, including my [website](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/site) and [NixOS configuration](https://codeberg.org/Liassica/nixos-config) have been moved to [my Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/Liassica). However, I still use this account for a few things.

GitHub won't let me add my committing email address to my account so my commits may show as "unverified" on the web UI. If you check manually you'll see it's me.
